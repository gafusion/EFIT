 NAME: 
     Get_Mtanh_Ts

 LANGUAGE: 
     fortran90

 PURPOSE: 
     Routine to return hyperbolic tangent fitting parameters for the Thomson
     Scattering system from the MDSplus database.  Data are interpolated 
     onto user-supplied time array.

 CALLING SEQUENCE: 
     call Get_Mtanh_Ts (shot, cdata, ntime, time, sym, wid, ped, stat) 

 INPUT PARAMETERS: 
     integer :: ishot            ! Desired shot number
     character(len=4) :: cdata   ! Desired source of tanhfit results;
                                 ! Use 'NE' for electron density
                                 ! Use 'TE' for electron temperature
                                 ! Use 'PE' for electron pressure
     integer :: ntime            ! Number of times at which data are desired
     real, dimension(ntime) :: time  ! Array of times (ms) at which data are
                                     ! requested


 OPTIONAL INPUT PARAMETERS: 

 KEYWORDS: 
     ETIME     efit time, ms
     EFMODE    mode for getting efit data
     RHOMAX    maximum rho for integration
     ADATA     structure containing data from A0 file
     GDATA     structure containing data from G0 file
     DELTIME   time window for efit data

 OUTPUTS: 
     real, dimension(ntime) :: sym   ! Symmetry points (m) on time grid
     real, dimension(ntime) :: wid   ! Full widths (m) on time grid
     real, dimension(ntime) :: ped   ! Pedestal values ont time grid;
                                     ! For cdata = 'NE', units are m-3
                                     ! For cdata = 'TE', units are eV
                                     ! For cdata = 'PE', units are kPa = 
                                     !                   1000 N/m**2
     logical :: stat                 ! True means no error; false means error

 SIDE EFFECTS: 
     NONE

 ERROR CONDITIONS which will return STAT of false:
     1) Tanhfit data not stored in MDSplus for requested shot.
     2) Values in time array extend beyond range of times for which tanhfit 
        data are stored in MDSplus.  

 OTHER RESTRICTIONS:
     1) Values in time array must be ordered in increasing order.  If this
        condition is not met, output is not to be trusted.
