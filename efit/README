Note that "makefile" should not present in this directory.  If there is one, 
use "Makefile" specifically, i.e., 
	make -f Makefile

Makefile - specify experiment as EXP, platform as MACH
	filter makefile.cpp thru cpp (C preprocessor) to makefile.temp,
	which is the final makefile to be used.

makefile.cpp - specify the library and the makefile to use for various 
	dependancies. Only DIIID part is available (JET part is the same 
	as DIIID in this file).
	SEXPDEPLIBS,DEXPDEPLIBS - experiment and platform dependant 
	libraries in single and double precisions. 

makefile.HPUX/IRIX/OSF - makefiles for various platforms.  
	Which to use needs be specified in makefile.cpp.  
	The difference is primaily compiling options. 
	It include makefile.edits to convert source files.

makefile.edits - convert from the master source code to the specified 
	platform (UNIX or VAX), grid sizes and precisions using editing 
	files in directory efitex.

For running efit with lf95 in linux machine please use the option -T while running to use the same green table available in hydra (big endian)
The command :

EFIT -Wl,-T

Unified, grid independent version submitted
Green table files will be generated with names "ecnwnh" and will be 
used directly. No need to move from one name to another
For changing the grid size, change in parameter statement used in 
the eparmd module (modules-efit.f90) 

Unified - F90 - mpi version
---------------------------
This contains 7 files with mpi extension. Corrections have to be done 
both sets so that the serial and mpi versions of EFIT-F90 can be maintained 
easily
