GitLab
======

Day-to-day development happens at the `EFIT GitLab repository <https://gitlab.com/efit-ai/efit>`__.
There, you can find the history and development version of the source code,
`see or create issues <https://gitlab.com/efit-ai/efit/issues>`__,
`see or create merge requests <https://gitlab.com/efit-ai/efit/-/merge_requests>`__,
and more. 




Slack and Mailing Lists
=========================

Discussion occurs on the EFIT-AI slack channel.

Comments and questions regarding EFIT design and development should go to efit-physics@ice.txcorp.com.

Configuration issues should be reported to efit-physics@ice.txcorp.com.

For bugs and other issues, we encourage users to create a `GitLab <https://gitlab.com>`__ account and
`file issues directly <https://gitlab.com/efit-ai/efit/issues>`__;
this allows better tracking of long-term bug reports and feature requests.


Developer workflow
===================

Due to the small team, we do not use an advanced plan of gitlab which allows
formal workflow rules to be set up, but rather rely on conventions.  Our
conventions are:

  + All development is in a branch
  + Merge requests are submitted by developer
  + Merges to main must be done by another developer to ensure code review
