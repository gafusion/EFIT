COMEGA,,"| Constraint matrix for P', FF', and POmega' when ICURRT=5 and KCOMEGA>0, in order of P', FF', and POmega'.
| Defines constraint equations of the form COMEGA(1,i) x(1) + COMEGA(2,i) x(2) +...+ COMEGA(n,i)
| x(n) = XOMEGA(i) for i=1 to KCOMEGA, where x = [alpha^T gamma^T omega^T]^T, n = KPPCUR+KFFCUR+KWWCUR. 
| Can scale coefficients up or down relative to nominal weights of 1 to get stronger or weaker constraint, respectively."
