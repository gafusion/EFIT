Variable, Default, Description
NBDRY, 0, "| This is the parameter which specifies that solution method
| is to be fixed boundary or free boundary equilibrium mode. Must set ICONVR=3.
| -n = write out boundary points in S(shot).t every other n points.
| 0 = do free boundary equilibrium solution (Default).
| n = fixed boundary calculation given n boundary points or boundary constraints.
| In fixed boundary mode, if successful will write out a x(shot).(time+1) file for free boundary runs using computed flux loop signals."
IFCURR, 0, "| (Integer flag) Fcoil Currents. Only used in free boundary equilibrium calculations.
| 1 = fixed F coil currents.
| 0 = variable F-coil currents (Default)
| Set = 0 in fitting and fixed boundary equilibrium solutions."
CFCOIL, -1.0, "| F coil stabilization constant for fixed boundary option.
| >0 = use input value
| <0 = normalize by plasma current (cfcoil=100/Ip*|cfcoil|)
| Magnitude balances whether currents vary smoothly (large value) or fit boundary closely (small values)."
ERRBRY, 1e-4, "Fixed boundary convergence criterion."
FCSUM, 1.0, "| Identifies which F-coils are included in fitted constraint that
| the sum of certain F coil currents is equal to zero. Length 18 vector with each entry having 2 possible values
| 0 = do not include current from this coil in the sum
| 1 = include current from this coil in the sum (default).
| Ignored unless IFREF = 2."

FWTBDRY, ones(nbdry),"""Fit Weight Boundary"". Fitting weight for boundary points, use with NBDRY."
IFREF,1, "| For use with fixed boundary equilibrium.
| 0 = don't adjust boundary flux.
| 1 = determine boundary flux by setting the sum of inner F-coil currents to zero.
| 2 = force sum of F-coil currents set by array FCSUM to be zero.
| 3 = minimize F-coil currents.
| 4 = set boundary flux to PSIBRY."
PSIBRY, 0.0, "Poloidal flux value for the boundary when solving in fixed boundary mode with IFREF=4."
