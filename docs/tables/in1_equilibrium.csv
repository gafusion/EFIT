NBDRY,"""Number Boundary"". This is the parameter which specifies that solution method is to be fixed boundary or free boundary equilibrium mode. Must set ICONVR=3."
,-n = write out boundary points in S(shot).t every other n points.
,0 = do free boundary equilibrium solution (Default).
,n = fixed boundary calculation given n boundary points or boundary constraints.
,"In fixed boundary mode, if successful will write out a x(shot).(time+1) file for free boundary runs using computed flux loop signals."
,
IFCURR,"""(Integer flag) Fcoil Currents"". Only used in free boundary equilibrium calculations."
,1 = fixed F coil currents.
,0 = variable F-coil currents (Default)
,Set = 0 in fitting and fixed boundary equilibrium solutions.
CFCOIL,F coil stabilization constant for fixed boundary option. - = fixed during iterations. Smoothly varying currents or fit boundary closely; more negative implies smoother. (What do positive values mean?) Default = -1.0
ERRBRY,"""Error Boundary"". Fixed boundary convergence criterion. Default = 10-4"
FCSUM,"""F-coil Sum"". Identifies which F-coils are included in fitted constraint that the sum of certain F coil currents is equal to zero. Length 18 vector with each entry having 2 possible values"
,0 = do not include current from this coil in the sum
,1 = include current from this coil in the sum (default).
,Ignored unless IFREF = 2.
FCZERO,"""Fcoil Zero"". Fitting weights for zero F coil currents in fixed boundary option. Set to 10000 for zero. Default = all 1.0's"
FWTBDRY,"""Fit Weight Boundary"". Fitting weight for boundary points, use with NBDRY. Default = all 1.0's"
IFREF,For use with fixed boundary equilibrium.
,1 =determine boundary flux by setting the sum of inner F-coil currents to zero.
,2 = sum of F-coil currents zero set by array FCSUM.
,3 = minimize F-coil currents.
,4 = set boundary flux to PSIBRY.
