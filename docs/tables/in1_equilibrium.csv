Variable, Default, Description
CFCOIL, -1.0, "| F coil stabilization constant for fixed boundary option.
| >0 = use input value
| <0 = normalize by plasma current (cfcoil=100/Ip*|cfcoil|)
| Magnitude balances whether currents vary smoothly (large value) or fit boundary closely (small values)."
ERRBRY, 1e-4, "Fixed boundary convergence criterion."
FCSUM, 1.0, "| Identifies which F-coils are included in fitted constraint that
| the sum of certain F coil currents is equal to zero. Length 18 vector with each entry having 2 possible values
| 0 = do not include current from this coil in the sum
| 1 = include current from this coil in the sum (default).
| Ignored unless IFREF = 2."
FCZERO, ones,"Fitting weights for zero F coil currents in fixed boundary option. Set to 10000 for zero. Default = all 1.0's"
FWTBDRY, ones(nbdry),"""Fit Weight Boundary"". Fitting weight for boundary points.  Only used with NBDRY>1."
IFCURR, 0, "| (Integer flag) Fcoil Currents. Only used in free boundary equilibrium calculations.
| 1 = fixed F coil currents.
| 0 = variable F-coil currents (Default)
| Set = 0 in fitting and fixed boundary equilibrium solutions."
IFREF,1, "| For use with fixed boundary equilibrium.
| 0 = don't adjust boundary flux.
| 1 = determine boundary flux by setting the sum of inner F-coil currents to zero.
| 2 = force sum of F-coil currents set by array FCSUM to be zero.
| 3 = minimize F-coil currents.
| 4 = set boundary flux to PSIBRY."
NBDRY, 0, "| This is the parameter controls how input RBDRY and ZBDRY arrays are used.
| -n = same as 0, but if GEQDSK_EXT is set write out boundary points in S(shot).t every other n points.
| 0 = don't use input RBDRY and ZBDRY, but boundary constraints may still be used if GEQDSK_EXT is set (Default).
| n = use first n elements of RBDRY and ZBDRY as fixed boundary boundary points or constraints.
| In fixed boundary constraints are used, if successful will write out a x(shot).(time+1) file for free boundary runs using computed flux loop signals."
PSIBRY, 0.0, "Poloidal flux value for the boundary when solving in fixed boundary mode with IFREF=4."
