Variable, Default, Description
ALPAX, 104,"| Initial value of coefficient alpha (specified by JBETA) of parametrization of P' to be 
| modified to satisfy beta constraint. (Note that this coefficient is unable to change sign
| during iteration in order to satisfy the constraint.)"
CCOILS,,"| Matrix which defines constraint for F coil currents I1, I2, ..., I18 of the form
| CCOILS(1,i) I1 + CCOILS(2,i) I2 + ... + CCOILS(18,i) I18 = XCOILS(i)for i=1,KCCOILS.
| Constraint applies in fixed boundary solutions only??"
