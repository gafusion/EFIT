Variable, Default, Description
A_EXT, -10., "Minor radius to scale boundary to.  Only used if SHAPE_EXT=True.  The existing boundary minor radius is preserved if unset."
DLOW_EXT, -10., "Lower (approximate) x-point major radius (r0ave-rz0min)/a0ave to scale boundary to.  Only used if SHAPE_EXT=True.  The existing boundary lower x-point position is preserved if unset."
DR_EXT, 0., "R shift applied to the input boundary (constraint).  This is used regardless of whether SHAPE_EXT is set and is applied before any rescaling is performed."
DUP_EXT, -10., "Upper (approximate) x-point major radius (r0ave-rz0max)/a0ave to scale boundary to.  Only used if SHAPE_EXT=True.  The existing boundary upper x-point position is preserved if unset."
DZ_EXT, 0., "Z shift applied to the input boundary (constraint).  This is used regardless of whether SHAPE_EXT is set and is applied before any rescaling is performed."
ELOW_EXT, -10., "Lower elongation (z0ave-z0min)/a0ave to scale boundary to.  Only used if SHAPE_EXT=True.  The existing boundary lower elongation is preserved if unset."
EUP_EXT, -10., "Upper elongation (z0ave-z0max)/a0ave to scale boundary to.  Only used if SHAPE_EXT=True.  The existing boundary upper elongation is preserved if unset."
FIXPP, False, "If set, then the only the FF' profile will be scaled to match the target Ip and no scaling will be applied to P'.  The default is to scale both profiles equally."
GEQDSK_EXT, 'none', "(String) The name of an existing g-file to use for setting fixed P' and FF' profiles, boundary constraints, limiter, and/or initial solution to restart from.  If omas input mode (1) is used, then the existing solution is assumed to be within the same file and instead GEQDSK_EXT/='none' is only used as a flag for reading these parts of the file.  The P' and FF' profiles in this file will be used for the initial condition if ICINIT=-3 or ICINIT=-4 and otherwise will have fixed shape for the simulation(and ICONVR=3 should be set).  They are not used if PSIN_EXT is set in this namelist.  If LIMITR<0 then the limiter shape from the file will be used instead of the standard limiter file."
NPSI_EXT, -1, "(Integer) Number of points to use in PSIN_EXT, FFPRIM_EXT, and PPRIME_EXT.  If PSIN_EXT is not set and GEQDSK_EXT/='none' then this will match the existing solution provided instead."
FFPRIM_EXT,, "(Array) Fixed shape for FF' in equilibrium mode (the magnitude will be scaled to match Ip).  Only used if PSIN_EXT is set in this namelist."
PPRIME_EXT,, "(Array) Fixed shape for P' in equilibrium mode (the magnitude will be scaled to match Ip if FIXPP=False).  Only used if PSIN_EXT is set in this namelist."
PSIN_EXT, -1000., "(Array) Normalized flux coordinate describing positions for FFPRIM_EXT and PPRIME_EXT in this namelist to be evaluated.  If this is set then ICONVR=3 should be used and the values in this namelist will be used regardless of whether GEQDSK_EXT is set.  Otherwise, if GEQDSK_EXT/='none' then this will match the existing solution provided instead."
RC_EXT, -10., "Center R position for rescaled boundary.  Only used if SHAPE_EXT=True.  The existing boundary center is retained if unset."
REFLECT_EXT, 'no', "| Option to reflect input plasma boundary (constraint).  This is applied regardless of how SHAPE_EXT is set and happens after the boundary has been scaled.
| no = don't reflect the boundary.
| UL = flip the boundary across Z=0.
| UU = set the lower half of the boundary to match the upper half.
| LL = set the upper half of the boundary to match the lower half."
SCALEFFP_EXT, 1., "Scaling factor applied to FFPRIM_EXT.  This is also applied if GEQDSK_EXT/='none' but not if ICINIT=-3 or ICINIT=-4."
SCALEPP_EXT, 1., "Scaling factor applied to PPRIME_EXT.  This is also applied if GEQDSK_EXT/='none' but not if ICINIT=-3 or ICINIT=-4."
SETLIM_EXT, -10., "Instead of using the limiter shape set by LIMITR, make a new rectangular limiter based on the boundary shape.  The value of SETLIM_EXT is used as a multiplier of plasma width and height to set the location of the new limiter (must be greater than 0).  Rleft=r0min-setlim_ext*(r0max-r0min), Rright=r0max+setlim_ext*(r0max-r0min), Ztop=z0max+setlim_ext*(z0max-z0min) and Zbottom=z0min-setlim_ext*(z0max-z0min).  These dimensions are based on the boundary after any shift, reshape, and/or reflection is applied and must lie within the computation domain specified by the Green function tables."
SHAPE_EXT, False, "Controls whether input boundary (constraint) is rescaled."
SIGN_EXT, 0., "Sign conversion factor multiplying FFPRIM_EXT, PPRIME_EXT, and (dividing) flux variables (from GEQDSK_EXT).  If this is not specified in the namelist, the default is to set it according to the standard EFIT or OMAS/IMAS COCOs factors, which depend on Ip.  If the profiles are from a different source, then SIGN_EXT should be set according to the COCOs transformation from there (and may need to include 2*pi factors as well)."
ZC_EXT, -10., "Center Z position for rescaled  boundary.  Only used if SHAPE_EXT=True.  The existing boundary center is retained if unset."
