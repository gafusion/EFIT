"AAnGAM (n = 1,2,3, or 4)",Length 16 vectors. Geometric correction coefficients for polarimetry data.
,This data is generated by EFIT during input mode 5 run and written into K-file.
DTMSEFULL,full width of MSE data time average window in ms.
,= 0.0 => use old 2*iavem as window (default)
FWTGAM,See namelist IN1.
IPLOTS,Plot polarimetry viewing points.
,>0: plot (default=1)
,<=0 : don't plot
KDOMSE,See namelist IN1.
KWAITMSE,iteration to begin calculating spatial average correction
,= 0 => turned off globally regardless of setting of mse_spave_on (default)
,So far experience has been that the correction should start after a few iterations
,(kwaitmse=3 or higher).
MSE_QUIET,#NAME?
,shared library during an efit run
,= 0 for minimum output (default)
,= 1 for basic information (recommended)
,= 3 for a trace of the calling sequence of routines
,= 6 for extensive output
,> 6 for even more output
MSE_SPAVE_ON,"= array of (-1, 0, 1) controlling spatial average correction calculation where:"
,"= -1 calculate, and output to mfile, but don't apply correction to gamma"
,= 0 don't calculate (default)
,= 1 calculate and apply spatial average correction to gamma being fit
,"Note: The default actually is mse_spave_on=69*0 which implies that the spatial average calculation is turned off globally with kwaitmse reset to zero (kwaitmse=0). Thus the user may set kwaitmse to a non-zero value, but this will be overriden if ms_spave_on = 69*0. Kwaitmse must be specified if the spatial average correction is desired. If some channels of mse_spave_on are non-zero, but kwaitmse is explicitely set to 0, then kwaitmse takes precedence and the spatial average is not done. This could be used to have some default setting of mse_spave_on in a snap file and use kwaitmse as a global on/off control."
MSEBKP,= background subtract mode:
,"0 = normal (default), 1 = multibeam, 2 = prior beam"
MSEFITFUN,#NAME?
,= 1 for tangent slope model (default)
,= 3 for tangent offset model
