Variable, Default, Description
AAnGAM(n=[1:7]]),zeros, "| Length of vector is machine dependent (16 for DIII-D), each entry of which is the geometric correction coefficient for the polarimetry data.
| This data is generated by EFIT during input mode 5 run and written into k-files."
DTMSEFULL,0.0, "| full width of MSE data time average window in ms.
| 0.0 => use old 2*iavem as window"
FWTGAM,zeros, "| Length of vector is machine dependent (16 for DIII-D), each entry of which is a fitting weight for polarimetry (MSE), 0 or 1.
| 0 = do not include measured data in fit (default)
| 1 = include measured data in fit"
IPLOTS,1,"| Plot polarimetry viewing points.
| >0: plot
| <=0 : don't plot"
KDOMSE,0, "| 1 = write out computed signals (gamma? tan(gamma)?) at MSE observation points in 
| NAMELIST format to the end of G EQDSK. Must have KEQDSK 1."
KWAITMSE,0,"| Iteration to begin calculating spatial average correction
| 0 => turned off globally regardless of setting of mse_spave_on
| So far experience has been that the correction should start after a few iterations
| (kwaitmse=3 or higher)."
MSE_QUIET,0,"| (Integer flag) Controls how much output comes from the MSE shared library during an efit run
| 0 = for minimum output 
| 1 = for basic information (recommended)
| 3 = for a trace of the calling sequence of routines
| 6 = for extensive output
| > 6 for even more output"
MSE_SPAVE_ON,0,"| (Integer flag) Array of (-1, 0, 1) controlling spatial average correction calculation where:
| -1 = calculate, and output to mfile, but don't apply correction to gamma
| 0 = don't calculate (default)
| 1 = calculate and apply spatial average correction to gamma being fit
| Note: The default actually is mse_spave_on=69*0 which implies that the spatial average
| set kwaitmse to a non-zero value, but this will be overriden if ms_spave_on = 69*0. 
| Kwaitmse must be specified if the spatial average correction is desired. If some channels 
| of mse_spave_on are non-zero, but kwaitmse is explicitely set to 0, then kwaitmse takes precedence
| and the spatial average is not done. This could be used to have some default setting of mse_spave_on
| in a snap file and use kwaitmse as a global on/off control."
MSE_USECER,0,"| (Integer flag) Controls whether CER corrections are applied to MSE measurements (when available)
| 0 = no CER correction
| 1 = CER correction is applied to MSE
| 2 = use CER to constrain the computed electric field"
MSEBKP,0,"| (Integer flag) Background subtraction mode
| 0 = normal
| 1 = multibeam
| 2 = prior beam"
MSEFITFUN,1,"| (Integer flag) Type of fitting function applied to MSE data.
| 1 = for tangent slope model
| 3 = for tangent offset model"
RRRGAM,zeros,Major radius in meters of MSE observation point.
SGAMMA,zeros,"Standard deviation for polarimetry measurement TGAMMA."
TGAMMA,zeros,"Tangent of the measured MSE polarization angle, TGAMMA = (A1*Bz + A5*Er) / (A2*BT+...)."
TGAMMAUNCOR,zeros,"TGAMMA measurements before any CER corrections have been applied."
ZZZGAM,zeros,Z location in meters of MSE observation points.
