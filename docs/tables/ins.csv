Variable, Default, Description
AAnGAM(n=[1:7]]), zeros, "| Length of vector is machine dependent (16 for DIII-D), each entry of which is the geometric correction coefficient for the polarimetry data.
| This data is generated by EFIT during input mode 5 run and written into k-files."
DTMSEFULL, 0.0, "| Full width of MSE data time average window in ms. (allows magnetics and mse averaging to be performed independently). *only used in snap mode (otherwise ignored)
| 0.0 => use old 2*iavem as window"
FWTGAM, zeros, "| Length of vector is machine dependent (16 for DIII-D), each entry of which is a fitting weight for polarimetry (MSE), 0 or 1.
| 0 = do not include measured data in fit (default)
| 1 = include measured data in fit"
IPLOTS, 1, "| Plot polarimetry viewing points.
| >0: plot
| <=0 : don't plot"
KDOMSE, 0, "| 1 = write out computed signals (gamma? tan(gamma)?) at MSE observation points in 
| NAMELIST format to the end of G EQDSK. Must have KEQDSK 1."
KWAITMSE, 0, "| Number of iterations to wait before calculating spatial average correction.
| 0 => turned off globally regardless of setting of mse_spave_on
| Rule of thumb is that correction should start after a few iterations (recommend kwaitmse=3 or higher)."
MSE_QUIET, 0, "| (Integer flag) Controls how much output comes from the MSE shared library during data fetching in snap mode.
| 0 = minimal output (default)
| 1 = basic information listing of sources of files used in the calculation of the pitch angles (recommended)
| 2 = everything above plus a trace of the channel being processed
| 3 = everything above plus a trace of the routines used in the calculation of the pitch angles
| 4 = everything above plus output of some beam timing information
| 5 = everything above plus output of averaging interval information
| 6 = everything above plus listing of exact data and timing used to generate pitch angles
| > 6 copious output generally increasing with value of the parameter"
MSE_SPAVE_ON, zeros, "| (Integer flag) Array of (-1, 0, 1) controlling whether spatial average corrections are applied to each channel.
| -1 = calculate and output correction to mfile, but don't apply to this gamma
| 0 = don't calculate correction (default)
| 1 = calculate and apply spatial average correction to this gamma
| Note: Kwaitmse must be specified if the spatial average correction is desired. If some channels of mse_spave_on are non-zero, but kwaitmse is explicitely set to 0, then kwaitmse takes precedence and the spatial average is not done. This could be used to have some default setting of mse_spave_on in a snap file and use kwaitmse as a global on/off control.  Non-zero kwaitmse will have no effect if ms_spave_on = zeros."
MSE_STRICT, 0, "| (Integer flag) Controls whether interpolation of MSE data is allowed. *only used in snap mode (otherwise ignored)
| 0 = allow interpolation (default)
| 1 = no interplotation, any time where there is no MSE data will have signal set to 0.0 for the MSE data(i.e. overrides fwtgam=1)."
MSE_USECER, 0, "| (Integer flag) Controls whether CER corrections are applied to MSE measurements (when available)
| 0 = no CER correction
| 1 = CER correction is applied to MSE
| 2 = use CER to constrain the computed electric field"
MSEBKP, 0, "| (Integer flag) Background subtraction mode. *only used in snap mode (otherwise ignored)
| 0 = normal: up to 1s before beam turn-on and up to 1s after beam turn-off with a 0.2s offset
| 1 = multibeam: use between beam blip intervals to form baseline average for each beam blip individually
| 2 = prior beam: use all mse data prior to t=0 only (no post-beam-off data)
| 3 = smooth: similar to option 0 but eliminates jumps in averaging interval
| 4 = only edges: use (t0, t0 + up to 1 s) and (t1 - up to 1 s, t1) with a 0.2 s offset where t0 is the initial beam on time and t1 is the final beam off time"
MSEFITFUN, 1, "| (Integer flag) Type of fitting function applied to MSE data.
| 1 = for tangent slope model (should be used for all shots prior to 2007)
| 3 = for tangent offset model (should be used for all shots after 2007 transition)"
OK_30RT, 0, "| (Integer flag) DIII-D specific parameter: Controls which 30 degree beam is used to calculate MSE polarization angles. *only used in snap mode (otherwise ignored)
| 0 = always use 30rt when it is on (default)
| 1 = allow 30lt use when 30rt is on. This should not be used unless 30rt is derated to less than ~65 kV. (Logic does not check voltage: this is up to the user to know)."
OK_210LT, 0, "| (Integer flag) DIII-D specific parameter: Controls which 210 degree beam is used to calculate MSE polarization angles. *only used in snap mode (otherwise ignored)
| 0 = always use 210lt when it is on (default)
| 1 = allow 210rt use when 210lt is on. This should not be used unless 210lt is derated to less than ~65 kV. (Logic does not check voltage: this is up to the user to know)."
RRRGAM, zeros, Major radius in meters of MSE observation point.
SGAMMA, zeros, "Standard deviation for polarimetry measurement TGAMMA."
TGAMMA, zeros, "Tangent of the measured MSE polarization angle, TGAMMA = (A1*Bz + A5*Er) / (A2*BT+...)."
TGAMMAUNCOR, zeros, "TGAMMA measurements before any CER corrections have been applied.  This is only used to check for Er correction if REQ_VALID=T (otherwise ignored)"
T_MAX_BEAM_OFF, 0.0, "| Maximum time between beam blips for which interpolation of MSE data is allowed (in ms). If the interfering beam (e.g. 30rt or 210lt) is on this is also taken into account. MSE data from 30lt/210rt is only valid when 30rt/210lt is off or 30rt/210lt derated < ~65 kV. For a timeslice within a window of invalid data interpolating over dt is allowed if dt is less than t_max_beam_off. Otherwise 0.0 will be returned for the measurement of the affected MSE channels and EFIT will not try to fit to them (i.e. overrides fwtgam=1).  Only used when set > 0.0. *only used in snap mode (otherwise ignored)
| Note: By default, EFIT will return an interpolated value for gamma when the beam is off.  In most cases, this is ok if the beam off times are short.  However, if beam pulses are well separated in time, the interpolated values can be inaccurate.  Setting t_max_beam_off prevents data from being returned in these cases."
ZZZGAM, zeros, Z location in meters of MSE observation points.
